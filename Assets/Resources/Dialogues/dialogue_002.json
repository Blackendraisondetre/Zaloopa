Formally a supporter of democratic values, but in private conversations expresses “nostalgia for strong leadership.” Teaches a course on 20th-century regimes, where he pays considerable attention to “effective dictatorships.”"

      "text": "Has influence over students and colleagues, making him a valuable asset. However, he is extremely cautious and will not engage in direct cooperation. Influence is possible through ideological surroundings, by creating an intellectual environment where dictatorship is seen as a logical, rational choice. A potential ideologue, if persuaded."
